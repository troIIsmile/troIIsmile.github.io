    <p>
      the trollsmile project can be described as a couple projects with a command parser at their core.
    </p>
    <p>
      That command parser (called trollsmile-core) was created in 2019 as a part of jackbot (web), and later ported to
      Discord, creating jackbot-discord.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the account that the trollsmile bot is on now, there used to be a bot also called JackBot. It was a GuideBot
      edit, and it wasn't good. I decided to port it to jackbot-discord, and the trollsmile bot was created.
      jackbot-discord was later merged into trollsmile.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2020, the trollsmile project was expanded with the creation of trollsmile admin, a Roblox admin system.
